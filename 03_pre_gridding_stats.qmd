## Libraries

```{r}
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(geosphere)
library(stringr)

## Import data

```{r}
# read csv
underway_obvs <- read_csv(here::here("data/underway_obvs.csv"))

# station data
station_data <- read.csv("data/LTERStns.csv", header = TRUE)
```

## Calculate distance between lat/long starts

```{r}
# create a matrix of coordinates for all points
coordinates <- cbind(underway_obvs$`Longitude Start`, underway_obvs$`Latitude Start`)

# compute distances between consecutive points
distances <- distHaversine(coordinates[-nrow(coordinates), ], coordinates[-1, ])

## Histograms

Split the data

```{r}

## separating the Date/Time column contents into separate columns
# extract the Julian day, hour, and minute from the `YearDay.Hour.Minute column
underway_obvs <- underway_obvs %>%
  mutate(
    `YearDay/Hour/Minute` = str_pad(as.character(`YearDay/Hour/Minute`), width = 7, pad = "0"),  # Ensure 7 characters
    JulianDay = substr(`YearDay/Hour/Minute`, 1, 3),  # Extract Julian Day (first 3 characters)
    Hour = substr(`YearDay/Hour/Minute`, 4, 5),       # Extract Hour (next 2 characters)
    Minute = substr(`YearDay/Hour/Minute`, 6, 7)      # Extract Minute (last 2 characters)
  )
```

Histogram of dates

```{r}
underway_obvs$JulianDay <- as.numeric(underway_obvs$JulianDay)

# plot histogram for JulianDay
ggplot(underway_obvs, aes(x = JulianDay)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightcoral", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Julian Days", x = "Julian Day", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 365, by = 30),  # set breaks every 30 days
                     labels = function(x) paste0("Day ", x))  
```

Histogram of Hours (with outliers)

```{r}
underway_obvs$Hour <- as.numeric(underway_obvs$Hour)

# check for non-numeric values or NA values
summary(underway_obvs$Hour)

# plot histogram treating Hour as a continuous variable
ggplot(underway_obvs, aes(x = Hour)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Hours", x = "Hour of Day", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Histogram of Hours (without outliers)

```{r}
# calculate Q1, Q3, and IQR (difference btwn Q3 and Q1)
Q1 <- quantile(underway_obvs$Hour, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
Q3 <- quantile(underway_obvs$Hour, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

# define the lower and upper bounds for outliers
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# filter out the outliers
underway_obvs_filtered <- underway_obvs %>%
  filter(Minute >= lower_bound & Minute <= upper_bound)

## histogram of hours
underway_obvs$Hour <- (underway_obvs$Hour)
hist(underway_obvs$Hour, breaks = 24, col = "lightblue", 
     main = "Histogram of Hours", xlab = "Hour of Day", ylab = "Frequency")
mean((underway_obvs$Hour), na.rm = TRUE)
```

Histogram of Minutes (with outliers)

```{r}
underway_obvs$Minute <- as.numeric(underway_obvs$Minute)

# check for non-numeric values or NA values
summary(underway_obvs$Minute)

# plot histogram treating Minute as a continuous variable
ggplot(underway_obvs, aes(x = Minute)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Hours", x = "Minute of Day", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Histogram of Minutes (without outliers)

```{r}
# calculate Q1, Q3, and IQR (difference btwn Q3 and Q1)
Q1 <- quantile(underway_obvs$Minute, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
Q3 <- quantile(underway_obvs$Minute, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

# define the lower and upper bounds for outliers
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# filter out the outliers
underway_obvs_filtered <- underway_obvs %>%
  filter(Minute >= lower_bound & Minute <= upper_bound)

# plot histogram after removing outliers
ggplot(underway_obvs_filtered, aes(x = Minute)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightgreen", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Minutes (Outliers Removed)", x = "Minute", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Summary stats for each histogram (without outliers)

```{r}
# summary statistics for Hour and Minute columns
summary_table <- underway_obvs %>%
  summarise(
    Hour_Min = min(Hour, na.rm = TRUE),
    Hour_Max = max(Hour, na.rm = TRUE),
    Hour_Mean = mean(Hour, na.rm = TRUE),
    Hour_Q25 = quantile(Hour, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),
    Hour_Median = median(Hour, na.rm = TRUE),
    Hour_Q75 = quantile(Hour, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE),

    Minute_Min = min(Minute, na.rm = TRUE),
    Minute_Max = max(Minute, na.rm = TRUE),
    Minute_Mean = mean(Minute, na.rm = TRUE),
    Minute_Q25 = quantile(Minute, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),
    Minute_Median = median(Minute, na.rm = TRUE),
